These papers describe the development of the MatRANS model, for simulating simple turbulent boundary layer flows in Matlab.  The original model development is described in Fuhrman et al. (2013).  Extension to include transitional k-omega turbulence closure is described in Williams and Fuhrman (2016) and Kirca et al. (2016).  Extension of the sediment transport model to handle graded sediment mixtures is described by Caliskan and Fuhrman (2017).
