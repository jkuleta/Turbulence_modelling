The MatRANS file structure is organized as follows:

MatRANS/src: Contains source code for current release.
MatRANS/src_old: Contains source code for previous releases.
MatRANS/Examples: Contains over 20 set up examples for simulating steady and wave boundary layers.
MatRANS/ModelDescription: Contains a LaTeX document describing the model (This needs to be updated to describe the transitional turbulence model and sediment mixtures).
MatRANS/Papers: Contains links to journal papers describing development and applications of MatRANS.
MatRANS/Courses: Contains files for simulations utilized in courses at DTU.
MatRANS/Work: Intended as a working directory for new users to organize new applications.

Brief description of versions: 
10: Basic turbulence and sediment transport models
20: Extended to include (1) transitional turbulence model and (2) sediment mixtures
21: Bug fix in transitional model, with updated setup for the relevant Examples (steady currents on smooth/rough beds as well as solitary wave boundary layers).

Have fun!
